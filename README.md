Hi, I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco, California. I studied computer science in college. Previously, I worked as a founding engineer at a YCombinator startup, mainly focused on reducing ambulance response times. I also worked at Axis Bank where I helped launch their neo-banking division and contributed to their internal design system. Right now I am working at Bright Minds as a full-stack dev.
