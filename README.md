Hey there, I'm Neil! Born and raised in Mumbai. I studied computer science in my college and kicked off my journey at HelpNow, a health tech startup backed by Y Combinator. There, I played a key role in reducing ambulance response time by a whopping 66%! Then I joined Axis Bank as a Full Stack Engineer to work on their fintech products.

2021 I moved to the US to pursue a masters in computer science. Now I am working at Bright Minds as a full-stack engineer.
