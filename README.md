Hey there, I'm Neil! Born and raised in Mumbai. I studied computer science in my college and kicked off my journey at HelpNow, a health tech startup backed by Y Combinator. There, I played a key role in reducing ambulance response time by a whopping 66%! Following that exhilarating stint, I joined Axis Bank as a Full Stack Engineer to work on their fintech products.

Feeling the pull for deeper insights, I made my way to the US to pursue a masters in computer science. And now? Well, I've found myself at Bright Minds, where every day brings new challenges and opportunities to innovate. Life's a journey, and I'm just enjoying the ride!
